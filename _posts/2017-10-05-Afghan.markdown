Afghanistan is a country located in Central Asia and South Asia. The country is popular in newspaper all over the world. Afghanistan has two official languages Pashto and Dari. Both of these languages are used as first language equally by the residents. Thatâ€™s why the country has newspapers in both Pashto and Dari. The country also has its own English version newspapers. For a country headlining the world we can surely expect a lot of news in the local newspapers also. Afghanistan also has a number of online news portals. The country also has its fair share of magazines. There are lots of weekly and monthly magazines. There are few sports pages in the newspapers as well. In other words a country struck by war but Afghanistan is still maintaining its country newspapers properly. There are few newspapers that is published in Pashto, Dari and English.
